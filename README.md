# Description

This tutorial app will allow you to place 3D Objects in AR space and interact with them

# Functionality, and capabilities
- Detect feature points (planes) in AR space using the camera
- Track user motion relative to placed objects and camera 
- Includes the use of ARKit, SceneKit & UIKit OS frameworks

# What we did: 
- Created a New Project for ARKit apps
- Set Up ARKit SceneKit View
- Connected ARSCNView with View Controller
- Connected IBOutlet Configuring ARSCNView Session Allowing Camera Usage
- Added 3D Object to ARSCNView
- Added Gesture Recognizer to ARSCNView
- Added Multiple Objects to ARSCNView
- Implemented a single node 3D object
- Implemented a multiple nodes 3D object

# Added capabilities:
- Resizing placed objects - using a slider or pinch gesture
- Rotating placed objects - using buttons on each side to rotate 90 degrees each time in the corresponding direction
- Resetting Position - remove all existing objects and start replacement of objects
- Hover to preview placement - tap and moving the finger across the screen will result in a preview of the 3D object placement with the moving finger
